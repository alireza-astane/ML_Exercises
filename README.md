# 🤖 Hands-On Machine Learning with Python

Welcome to the **Hands-On Machine Learning with Python** project!  
This repository contains a comprehensive, hands-on exploration of various machine learning techniques using Python and widely-used libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`. Each topic is covered with real-world datasets and focuses on learning by doing.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Implement and compare a variety of **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning methods.
- Practice **data preprocessing**, **feature selection**, and **visualization**.
- Explore **model evaluation**, **hyperparameter tuning**, and **pipelines**.
- Gain experience with **ensemble methods**, **time series**, and **natural language processing**.
- Learn to build and structure machine learning projects professionally.
